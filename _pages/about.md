Hello! I’m Erfan Moghadam, a Computer Engineering gradute student at [Kharazmi University](https://khu.ac.ir/en), where I am advised by Amir Asghari and Mohammadreza Binesh Marvasti within the School of Engineering. My research interests are at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Health Analytics, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Generative AI. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Zanjan University, Iran, with a GPA of 3.27/4, and I’m currently pursuing my Master of Science with a perfect GPA of 4/4.

I have two publications currently under review, and you can find details about my selected projects in my CV, which is available on this website. The goal of this site is to share my research, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and provide useful resources in the fields I’m passionate about.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I’m an avid fitness enthusiast. I enjoy running, swimming, playing badminton, and staying active in general.
